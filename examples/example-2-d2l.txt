# Questions from a fictious PIZZA 101 course

# This one adds differing POINTS and DIFFICULTY
#
# (I normally don't use DIFFICULTY levels, and also normally import into
#  a Library Pool, so there even the Points doesn't matter)

# Special inputs are comments that begin with #@

#@Points: 10	-- Change both T/F and MC questions to be 10 points/question

#@TF_Points: 5	-- Change only T/F questions to be 5 points/question
#@MC_Points: 7	-- Change only MC questions to be 7 points/question
